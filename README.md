MPC control for COVID-19 spread

A compartmental model was developed for the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa (see http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08012). Different lockdown levels have been proposed by the South African government. This repo shows how the spread of the virus can be controlled via Model Predictive Control (MPC).
